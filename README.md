## Features

- **View Calendar Events**: List events within a date range, view event details, check attendee status
- **Manage Calendar Events**: Create new events and meetings, update existing events
- **Calendar Intelligence**: Find free time slots for scheduling, identify optimal meeting times
- **Multiple Calendar Support**: Access different calendars in your Outlook profile

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Microsoft Outlook desktop client installed
- **VBScript support** (see VBScript Installation below if you're on Windows 11 24H2+)
- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### VBScript Installation (Windows 11 24H2+ Users)

**Important**: Starting with Windows 11 24H2, VBScript is no longer installed by default and must be enabled as an optional feature.

If you're experiencing issues with the MCP server not working after a Windows update, you likely need to install VBScript:

1. Open **Settings** (Windows + I)
2. Go to **Apps** â†’ **Optional features**
3. Click **"View features"** next to **"Add an optional feature"**
4. Search for **"VBScript"**
5. Select **VBScript** and click **Install**
6. Restart your computer after installation

**VBScript Deprecation Timeline:**
- **Phase 1** (Late 2024+): Available as optional feature in Windows 11 24H2
- **Phase 2** (~2027): Will no longer be enabled by default
- **Phase 3** (Future): Complete removal from Windows

*Note: Thanks to community feedback about VBScript deprecation, I'm considering architectural improvements to make the project more future-proof.*

## Usage

Once configured, Claude will have access to the following tools:

### List Calendar Events

```
list_events
- startDate: Start date in MM/DD/YYYY format
- endDate: End date in MM/DD/YYYY format (optional)
- calendar: Calendar name (optional)
```

Example: "List my calendar events for next week"

### Create Calendar Event

```
create_event
- subject: Event subject/title
- startDate: Start date in MM/DD/YYYY format
- startTime: Start time in HH:MM AM/PM format
- endDate: End date in MM/DD/YYYY format (optional)
- endTime: End time in HH:MM AM/PM format (optional)
- location: Event location (optional)
- body: Event description (optional)
- isMeeting: Whether this is a meeting with attendees (optional)
- attendees: Semicolon-separated list of attendee email addresses (optional)
- calendar: Calendar name (optional)
```

Example: "Add a meeting with John about the project proposal on Friday at 2 PM"

### Find Free Time Slots

```
find_free_slots
- startDate: Start date in MM/DD/YYYY format
- endDate: End date in MM/DD/YYYY format (optional)
- duration: Duration in minutes (optional)
- workDayStart: Work day start hour (0-23) (optional)
- workDayEnd: Work day end hour (0-23) (optional)
- calendar: Calendar name (optional)
```

Example: "When am I free for a 1-hour meeting this week?"

### Get Attendee Status

```
get_attendee_status
- eventId: Event ID
- calendar: Calendar name (optional)
```

Example: "Who hasn't responded to my team meeting invitation?"

> **Important Note**: When using operations that require an event ID (update_event, delete_event, get_attendee_status), you must use the `id` field from the list_events response. This is the unique EntryID that Outlook uses to identify events.

### Update Calendar Event

```
update_event
- eventId: Event ID to update
- subject: New event subject/title (optional)
- startDate: New start date in MM/DD/YYYY format (optional)
- startTime: New start time in HH:MM AM/PM format (optional)
- endDate: New end date in MM/DD/YYYY format (optional)
- endTime: New end time in HH:MM AM/PM format (optional)
- location: New event location (optional)
- body: New event description (optional)
- calendar: Calendar name (optional)
```

Example: "Update my team meeting tomorrow to start at 3 PM instead of 2 PM"

### Get Calendars

```
get_calendars
```

Example: "Show me my available calendars"

## Security Notes

- On first use, Outlook may display security prompts to allow script access
- The tool only accesses your local Outlook client and does not send calendar data to external servers
- All calendar operations are performed locally on your computer

## Troubleshooting

- **VBScript Not Available (Windows 11 24H2+)**: If you get errors after a Windows update, VBScript may need to be installed. See [VBScript Installation](#vbscript-installation-windows-11-24h2-users) section above
- **"Script execution failed" errors**: Usually indicates VBScript is not available or Outlook is not accessible
- **Outlook Security Prompts**: If you see security prompts from Outlook, you need to allow the script to access your Outlook data
- **Script Execution Policy**: If you encounter script execution errors, you may need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy
- **Path Issues**: Ensure the path in your MCP configuration file points to the correct location of the tool
